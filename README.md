# C_minesweeper_stuffs
<i>Minesweeper was a final project in a basic C programming course, and in this repository, its stuffs are.</i>


Some notes:

This is not the cleanest code ever, as it still has for example some print outs to see what the cell check algorithm is doing; and perhaps making some functions recursive would simplify the code. 

In this game, user can: 
  - choose levels 
  - flag or open mines
  - win by flagging all correct mines
  - also, there is no timer yet
  
All functions are written in the main file except one, there is no special reason for this. The ultimate goal is to have a .h file for functions other than main.

I update this for fun when I have time, feel free to make suggestions ^.^
